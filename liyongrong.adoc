李波小妹歌
李波小妹字雍容，
褰裙逐马如卷蓬。
左射右射必叠双。
妇女尚如此，
男子安可逢?

Li Po's Little Sister

Yong Rong is Li Po's little sis
Her name means "perfect poise."
She hikes her skirt above her knees
And rides like wind-swept bush.
She shoots to left and shoots to right, 
The bodies pile in pairs.
Where can a man perchance to meet
A girl of skill so rare?
