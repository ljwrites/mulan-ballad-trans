唧唧復唧唧，木蘭當戶織。不聞機杼聲，惟聞女嘆息。(惟聞 通：唯)

Hark to the sound of murmurs fill the room;
Mulan across the door does toil at loom.
The shuttle slacks; the clacking silent falls,
The only sound the maid's lamenting call.

問女何所思，問女何所憶。女亦無所思，女亦無所憶。昨夜見軍帖，可汗大點兵，軍書十二卷，卷卷有爺名。阿爺無大兒，木蘭無長兄，願爲市鞍馬，從此替爺徵。

Ask the girl where her thoughts go,
Ask the girl whom she remembers.
But the girl's thoughts go nowhere,
Nor is she sunk in daytime dreams.
Last night the military rolls were seen,
The Khan is making a great muster of soldiers
Twelve are the volumes of military rolls,
And each one bearing Father's name.
Father has no grown son,
And Mulan has no elder brother,
She wants to buy saddle and horse at market,
And then take Father's place in the muster.

東市買駿馬，西市買鞍韉，南市買轡頭，北市買長鞭。旦辭爺孃去，暮宿黃河邊，不聞爺孃喚女聲，但聞黃河流水鳴濺濺。旦辭黃河去，暮至黑山頭，不聞爺孃喚女聲，但聞燕山胡騎鳴啾啾。

At the Eastern market buy a fine horse,
At the Western market buy a saddle and gear,
At the Southern market buy a bridle and reign,
At the Northern market buy a long whip.
In the morning take leave of parents,
By night sleep by the side of the Yellow River,
Hear not the sound of parents' call,
Only the Yellow River roar and spray.
In the morning say good-bye to the Yellow River in the morning, 
At night reach the base of the Black Mountains,
Hear not the sound of parents' call,
Only the Yanshan barbarian horsemen roar and chatter.

萬里赴戎機，關山度若飛。朔氣傳金柝，寒光照鐵衣。將軍百戰死，壯士十年歸。

The machinery of war travels a thousand leagues,
Crossing gateways and mountains as though flying,
The cold air carries metallic strikes,
Cold light shines on clothes of steel.
Soldiers fall in a hundred battles,
In ten years some make it back.

歸來見天子，天子坐明堂。策勳十二轉，賞賜百千強。可汗問所欲，木蘭不用尚書郎，願馳千里足，送兒還故鄉。(一作：願借明駝千里足)

She returns to see the Son of Heaven
Who sits on his throne of light.
Her brave deeds fill twelve books,
Hundreds and thousands in prze money.
The Khan asks if she dsires aught,
Of high office and honor Mulan wishes nought,
Only to ride a thousand miles,
Therefore to go home.

爺孃聞女來，出郭相扶將；阿姊聞妹來，當戶理紅妝；小弟聞姊來，磨刀霍霍向豬羊。開我東閣門，坐我西閣牀，脫我戰時袍，著我舊時裳。當窗理雲鬢，對鏡貼花黃。出門看火伴，火伴皆驚忙：同行十二年，不知木蘭是女郎。（貼 通：帖；驚忙 一作：惶）

Her parents on hearing of their daughter's return,
Lean on each other to come out the city gates;
Big Sister, on hearing little sister is coming home,
Starts putting on makeup and beautiful clothes by the door,
Little Brother, on hearing big sister is coming home,
Sharpens his knife and hurries to the pigs and sheep.

I open the door to the east,
Sit at the platform to the west,
I take off the cloak of wartime,
And put on the skirt of old times.
By the window fix cloud-like hair,
Before the mirror fix yellow flowers to forehead.

She opens the door to greet her comrades,
And they are to a man shocked and flustered;
Together were they twelve years,
And none knew Mulan was a woman.

雄兔腳撲朔，雌兔眼迷離；雙兔傍地走，安能辨我是雄雌？

The male rabbit kicks its legs,
While the female tends to squint;
When the two are running close to ground,
Can you tell if I am male or female?
