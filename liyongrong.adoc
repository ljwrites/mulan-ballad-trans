李波小妹歌
李波小妹字雍容，
褰裙逐马如卷蓬。
左射右射必叠双。
妇女尚如此，
男子安可逢?

Li Po's Little Sister

Yong Rong is Li Po's little sis
Her name means "perfect poise."
She hikes her skirt and rides a horse
The bush swept in her winds.
She shoots to left and shoots to right, 
The bodies pile in pairs.
Where can a man perchance to meet
A girl of skill so rare?
